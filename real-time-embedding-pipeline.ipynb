    "# How to Make an up to date AI chat bot\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT and other AI chatbots are amazing, they can write blog posts, emails, fix bugs, document code and have been shown to complete tasks like planning trips all based off of natural language prompts. Despite all of the capabilities they fall short with respect to the most recent information of the world, out-of-domain knowledge or might provide incorrect information without the right prompting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to helping the language model with those areas that it falls short is sophisticated prompt templating and injecting information into the context. For example, if I were to ask chatGPT, \n",
    "\n",
    ">\"What happened with Meta in the news today?\" \n",
    "\n",
    "I would get the response:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"I'm sorry, but my training data only goes up until September 2021, and I'm unable to provide real-time news updates. To find out the latest news about Meta (formerly known as Facebook), please visit a reliable news website or search for \"Meta news\" in your preferred search engine.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "But I could solve this problem by providing more information as context and the right prompt. For example I could copy and paste an article and change the prompt to something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Given this article from today: `Article about META in the news today`. Answer the following: What happened with Meta in the news today?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I now get the response:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"In the news today, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of Twitter, has accused Meta's messaging app, WhatsApp, of being untrustworthy. The accusation was based on a tweet by a Twitter engineer, Foad Dabiri, who claimed that WhatsApp had been using the microphone in the background without their knowledge. Musk pointed out that WhatsApp cannot be trusted and reminded people that WhatsApp is owned by Meta (previously Facebook) and that its founders left Meta in disagreement over its policies and decisions, particularly regarding personal data processing. This news may have an impact on Meta's public image and its platforms, as trust and privacy are crucial factors for users of social media and messaging apps.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This is basic and over simplified, but the idea is that we can help the language model provide what we ultimately want with a little bit of work asking the right things and giving it the right information as context. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we understand that this works for our one-off use case, how can we make something that will scale to many questions about different subjects? This is where vector databases and embeddings come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an embedding and a vector database?\n",
    "\n",
    "An embedding is simply a representation of something as a vector, or in other words a list of numbers. It is a way to intelligently turn categorical things into numerical representations so that we can reason about them in different ways, like determine how similar they are group them in multi-dimensional space. A vector database is a database that allows us to store our embeddings as vectors so that we can efficiently retrieve them. Since the vectors can be compared for similarity, our query against the database will be able to return the most similar items.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we can consume news as it is created, create embeddings to represent the news and then store it in a vector database. When we ask a question we will be able pull the articles most similar to our query, give them to a large language model as context and then ask the language model to provide us with information. \n",
    "\n",
    "To support the ingestion, we will need to make a pipeline that is capable of ingesting data in real-time, processing it, running it against an ML model to create an embedding and then write it to a veector database. We can use Bytewax as the real-time processing framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building the pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to leverage Bytewax to create a real-time embedding pipeline from a live news source, in this case it is a financial news source via Alpaca. This pipeline could be scaled to consume many different news sources and aggregate them all into a vector database like Qdrant shown below."
